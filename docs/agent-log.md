# Agent Maintenance Log

## 2026-07-26 — Training protocol and maintainability repair

- Fixed the `ett_all` train/validation/test dataset selection condition.
- Made the effective loss name authoritative and retained legacy Huber flags
  only as compatibility metadata.
- Changed official and research runners to evaluate the lowest-validation-loss
  checkpoint and use that same model for bad-case export.
- Replaced the standalone Traffic training loop with the shared preset runner,
  removing per-epoch access to the test set.
- Moved PhaseFormer weak-period and phase-adaptation helpers into
  `src/models/phase_adapters.py` while preserving public imports and state-dict
  keys.
- Added a uv project definition with separate core, development, and GIFT-Eval
  dependency groups.
- Validation commands:
  - `uv run pytest -q` — 7 passed.
  - `uv run python -m compileall -q config src scripts run_*.py`.
  - All seven official dataset entry points completed `--help` smoke checks.
  - `smoke_best_checkpoint_protocol_20260726b` completed a two-epoch GPU
    training/test cycle and restored `checkpoints/best.ckpt` before evaluation.
- Environment: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090; PyTorch 2.7.1+cu126; CUDA 12.6.
- Protocol compatibility: historical benchmark files used last-epoch weights.
  New best-checkpoint results require matched original/latest reruns and must
  not be compared directly with those historical metrics.
